# Data Visualization Class Examples

I'm Jon Richards, the Instructory for the 2020-2021 Data Visualization and Data Analytics Bootcamp, UC Berkeley Extension, Monday/Wednesday class.

This repository is a place where I'll place various examples and code as I am working through them and explaining them. This will be a mish-mash, a bit of this and a bit of that.

## python

This directory contains some examples relating to Python and also Pandas. I'll go through these in class.

## nfl

This directory contains examples using historical data from the National Football League (AKA the NFL). 

These examples use Python Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze the data and draw plots. Modules 4 and 5 cover these topics, but my attempt here is to show more examples of plotting and readig in CSV files for analysis.
